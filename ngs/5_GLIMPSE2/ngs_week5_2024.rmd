### Next Generation Sequence Analysis Homework Week 5, 2024

In this assignment, you will learn about filtering of low quality SNPs
with Variant Quality Score Recalibration approach, imputation in low
coverage whole genome sequencing applications, and will perform
imputation using the new GLIMPSE2 package.

#### Assignment Objective

After completing the assignment, students will understand key concepts
in filtering SNP data from NGS workflows, be able to subset a SNP
callset in VCF, and will have experience performing imputation on a low
coverage (1X) sequencing dataset.

#### Completing your assignment

Your answers to multiple choice questions can be entered via the
"Quiz"-\>"Assignment 5A (2024)" link on Brightspace. You can upload
required files (a) job script from Q1.8 and acc_plot.png from Q2.4 to
"Assignments"-\>"Assignment 5B (2024)".

#### About the data

This week you will work with VCFs produced by the Sarek haplotypecaller
joint-genotyping workflow (from Week 4) and will perform imputation on a
downsampled sampled BAM from the 1000 genomes project.

#### Additional readings

Biobank scale projects: All of Us (U.S.): All of Us Investigators,

#### Task 1: The VCF format and selecting variants that passed the VQSR-based sensitivity filter

The final outputs of the haplotypecaller joint-genotyping workflow in
the Sarek pipeline from Week 4 was two Variant Call Format (VCF) files
with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion deletion (indel)
calls for the four low coverage human samples.

You can find both files `joint_germline.vcf.gz` and
`joint_germline_recalibrated.vcf.gz` in your Week 4 outputs in the
directory where you ran Sarek
`res/variant_calling/haplotypecaller/joint_variant_calling/`

If you no longer have the two VCFs, you can find copies of them at
`/scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024`.

A few keys observations:

-   The desired two output VCFs have genotypes for all samples at each
    SNP or indel site\
-   The VCFs only have sites that are variable in these four samples
    (i.e., invariant or "monomorphic" sites are not in the file).\
-   Both files have all the raw variant calls--low quality variants that
    are commonly reported by most variant callers **have not been
    removed**

The second point warrants some explanation. Isn't the point of whole
genome sequencing (WGS) to obtain the entire genome sequence? For most
short read-based WGS applications (e.g., Genome-wide Association
Studies), a "variants-only" VCF is of primary interest because there is
no need to consider the invariant sites which are assumed to either
match the reference genome or, possibly, have had insufficient data to
confidently call a variant. However, there are some instances where it
is desirable to output an "all sites" VCF where the genotype at all
positions in the reference genome are reported. The GATK Haplotypecaller
(e.g., implemented by Sarek) can be configured to output such a VCF,
although this is a rare use case. One such example is in population
genomics where quantifying levels of genetic diversity and other
properties of populations requires knowledge of whether a site is
invariant because it is truly monomorphic or because it has insufficient
information to call it polymorphic.

The third point above concerns filtering of variants, which must be
considered carefully by data analysts. To begin, review page 6
(concerning filter descriptions in the VCF header) and page 9
(concerning the application of filter tags to the FILTER column of
individual variant records) of the VCF specification
<https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf>.

Review the two multi-sample VCFs produced by Sarek haplotypecaller
joint-genotyping workflow and answer the following question.

Tip: when using `less` to view a file, you may search the file for a
word by typing `/<word to search for>`. After the first match is found,
you may then enter 'n' (i.e., next) to find the next match. In the
variant records that follow, notice that all positions in the genome are
not represented. Another thing to notice is that in columns 10-13 are
sample-specific information including the genotype at each site.

``` bash
gunzip -c /scratch/kk4764/ngs/nextflow/res/variant_calling/haplotypecaller/joint_variant_calling/joint_germline_recalibrated.vcf.gz | less 
```

**Q1.1 Which of the following best describes the difference in the
FILTER column between the two VCFs? Select all that apply \[ 1 point
\]**

a.  joint_germline.vcf.gz has had filters applied to the FILTER column,
    joint_germline_recalibrated.vcf.gz has not\
b.  joint_germline_recalibrated.vcf.gz has had filters applied to the
    FILTER column, joint_germline.vcf.gz has not\
c.  joint_germline.vcf.gz has had low quality variants (those that do
    not pass filters) removed\
d.  joint_germline_recalibrated.vcf.gz\
e.  neither files have had low quality variants removed

Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) was introduced in the Week 4
pre-recorded videos with additional details particularly about the
concept of Variants Quality Score Log Odds (VQSLOD) (the log odds that
the SNP is true vs.Â false) and the sensitivity tranche concept in last
week's live session.

Additional details are here:
<https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531612-Variant-Quality-Score-Recalibration-VQSR>

Its important to recognize that the VQSR approach is preferred over hard
filtering, or 'thresholding', alternatives that are ad hoc and difficult
to evaluate rigourously
<https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890471-Hard-filtering-germline-short-variants>.
If you are analyzing non-model organism data you will most likely have
to use hard filtering. If you are working with humans or other model
genetic organisms with gold standard SNP databases, then you will want
to adopt the VQSR approach.

**Q1.2 Which of the following are true statements with respect to the
sensitivity tranche approach of GATK. Select all that apply.\[ 1 point
\].**

a.  99.9% of all true SNPs are expected to be in the 99.9% sensitivity
    tranche
b.  99.9% of all false negative SNPs are expected to be in the 99.9%
    sensitivity tranche
c.  99.9% of all false positive SNPs are expected to be in the 99.9%
    sensitivity tranche
d.  increassing the sensitivity above 99.9% would increase the number of
    false positives
e.  increasing the sensitivity above 99.9% would decrease the number of
    false positives

**Q1.3 Review the first two variants, rs546169444 and rs62635297 ("rs"
refers to the Reference SNP id) in the recalibrated VCF file from the
Sarek output here:
`/scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/joint_germline_recalibrated.vcf.gz`.
Note the FILTER column and the VQSLOD attribute in the INFO column.
Which of the following describes these two variants. Select the single
best answer \[ 1 point \]**

a.  rs546169444 passed filter and has a VQSLOD greater than the VQSLOD
    score at rs62635297\
b.  rs546169444 passed filter and has a VQSLOD less than the VQSLOD
    score at rs62635297\
c.  rs62635297 passed filter and has a VQSLOD greater than the VQSLOD
    score at rs546169444\
d.  rs62635297 passed filter and has a VQSLOD less than the VQSLOD score
    at rs546169444

The transition:transversion (ts:tv) ratio provides a means of
differentiating set of SNPs with different error rates. If you are
unfamiliar with transition and transversion classes of mutation, revew
that here:

The basis for this is that in most organisms, including humans, the
ts:tv ratio is approximately 2:1 (or as high as 3:1 in protein-coding
exons). However, there are twice as many transversion mutation types
than transition, and the expectation for the ts:tv is therefore 1:2
(assuming a random mutation process). Since machine artifacts and other
sources of error are expected to introduce mutations more or less
randomly, classes of SNPs enriched for false positives are expected to
have a lower ts:tv.

Sarek runs vcftools <https://vcftools.github.io/index.html> to summarize
the ts:tv in classes of SNPs with different tags in the FILTER column in
file `joint_germline_recalibrated.FILTER.summary`. This file is located
in your Week 4 Sarek pipeline results
`res/reports/vcftools/haplotypecaller/joint_variant_calling` or in the
course directory at `/scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024`).

**Q1.4 Which of the following best describes the pattern of ts:tv in
SNPs passing filter ("PASS") versus SNPs outside the 99% sensitivity
tranche? Select the single best answer \[ 1 point \]**

a.  The ts:tv is approximately 2 in both PASS and the SNPs that failed
    filter\
b.  The ts:tv is approximately 2 in PASS, and 0.5 in SNPs that failed
    filter\
c.  The ts:tv is approximately 2 in PASS, and 1.5 in SNPs that failed
    filter\
d.  The ts:tv is approximately 3 in PASS, and 1 in SNPs that failed
    filter

**Q1.5 Is the pattern in the previous question consistent with a lower
error rate in SNPs that passed filter? \[ 1 point \]**

a.  True\
b.  False

**Q1.6 What is the primary reason why in most organisms with
re-sequencing data it is impossible perform VQSR to identify low quality
SNPs for removal from a call set. Select the single best answer \[ 1
point \]?**

a.  most organisms have repetitive genomes and reads cannot be
    confidently mapped\
b.  most organisms have low quality reference genomes and positional
    coordinates of SNPs are unknown\
c.  most organisms have a transition:transversion ration of 2:1\
d.  most organisms do not have a truth call set (i.e., "gold-standard
    database") of known SNPs

The final step required before analysis of the recalibrated VCF is to
extract SNPs only (i.e., exclude indels) and remove variants that did
not pass the filtering process (i.e., do not have "PASS" in the FILTER
column). This can be performed with the SelectVariants tool in the GATK.

Devise a SelectVariants command line that will keep only SNPs and only
those SNPs that pass filter. You can use the documentation page here:
<https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/13832694334235-SelectVariants>

Note: You can use the example under "Select SNPs" but you will need to
add an `--exclude-filtered` option (see documenation) to remove SNPs
that failed the filtering protocol.

Create a slurm job that will run your SelectVariants command. Load the
most recent GATK module on the HPC and **execute your command on the VCF
here
`scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/joint_germline_recalibrated.vcf.gz`**.
Your command should output a new VCF to your `/scratch`.

The human reference genome fasta used in the Sarek pipeline is required
for your command. It is located in
`/scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw4.2024/sarek/GATKBundle/`

When you are ready, execute your script using `sbatch`.

**Q1.7 How many SNPs are there in your final analysis ready VCF? \[ 1
point \]**

a.  1,343,452\
b.  1,359,864\
c.  1,368,304\
d.  1,371,717

**Q1.8 Save your job script for submission to Brightspace at the
completion of your assignment \[ 4 points \]**


##### Task 2: GLIMPSE2 imputation of missing genotypes in low coverage datasets

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) using short read technologies
traditionally requires high coverage (i.e., \>20X) to accurately call
genotypes (i.e., to infer whether an individual is homo- or heterozygous
at each position in the genome). Sequencing at this depth is expensive.
Recently, there has been a paradigm shift where WGS has been conducted
at biobank scale using low coverage data and then using computational
imputation to return accurate genotypes despite the low coverage.

What is imputation in this context? Imputation is the process of filling
in missing genotypes or improving low quality genotype calls. The main
approach is to use information from the correlations among genotypes at
closely linked sites (i.e., linkage disequilibrium) in a reference panel
such as HapMap or 1000 Genomes to predict unknown genotypes in low
coverage samples. The correlations among sites is inferred from large
reference populations in which the phase of alleles on a chromosome has
been established (i.e., the DNA sequence of both haplotypes is known for
each of the 22 human autosomes). Knowledge of the frequency of these
haplotypes in reference populations allows low quality or missing
genotypes to be inferred probabilistically in samples that are not part
of the reference set.

Using a trivial (but also very possible) example, consider the situation
where an allele A at position X is always found on the same physical
chromosome molecule as a C at a tightly linked position Y and a G at
position X is always associated with a T at position Y in a reference
population. Now consider a low coverage individual not in the reference
set. If this individual is an A/G heterozygote at position X, then it is
highly likely that a missing genotype call at position Y is
heterozygous, G/T, provided that the individual is of similar genetic
ancestry as the reference population.

Imputation was initially used primarily in Genome-wide Association
Studies (GWAS) using genotyping array ('SNP Chip') data. This allows
genotype data to be predicted even for SNP loci that are not on the
genotyping array thereby increasing the density of marker loci and
improving fine-mapping. In NGS, imputation is similarly used to infer
genotypes at untyped sites in low coverage sequencing datasets.

Another important concept is that imputation produces probabilistic
genotype predictions. It is never know with certainty what genotype an
individual has. Instead, we have a probability that an individual is
0/0, 0/1, or 1/1. From this we can calculate the dosage--the expected
number of copies of allele 1. This probabilistic value can then be
included in linear models in Genome-wide Association studies directly,
thereby taking uncertaintly in genotype into account when mapping
traits.

GLIMPSE is a software developed by a team at the University of Lausanne
(Switzerland) (Rubinacci et al.Â 2021 Nature Genetics
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00756-0>) that performs
imputation on low coverage data. See:
<https://www.illumina.com/science/genomics-research/articles/boosting-variant-calling-performance-with-DRAGEN-and-IRPv1-for-imputation.html>).
More recently, the same team published a method that accurately imputes
genotypes in low coverage genome sequences at a biobank scale by
implementing a number of upgrades to computational efficiency (Rubinacci
et al.Â Nature Genetics 2023
<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-023-01438-3>). This has been released in
a software package called GLIMPSE2 and is being incorporated into an
nf-core pipeline called phaseimpute (currently under development:
<https://nf-co.re/phaseimpute/dev>).

Why should we care? Imputation is a powerful tool that could
dramatically expand the use of WGS in precision and personalized
medicine. It allows genomes to be sequenced at lower coverage, thus
lowering costs, and has enabled both the expansion of biobank datasets
and application of clinical sequencing to larger numbers of patients. An
immediate benefit of accurate genotypes in large scale projects like the
UK Biobank or All of Us (U.S.) is that models of polygenic disease can
be developed from GWAS data and the risk of polygenic disease can be
accurately predicted in the clinic. The first ever report that utilizes
Biobank scale data to predict the risk of polygenic disease from genome
sequence data was published in 2018 by a research team at Harvard
Medical School, MIT, and Massachusetts General Hospital (Khera et
al.Â 2018, Nature Genetics <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0183-z>).
Therefore, improved imputation of low coverage data would help bring to
fruition the promise of personalized medicine.

**Q2.1 Which of the following best describes the principle by which
missing genotypes can be imputed in sequencing data? \[ 1 point \]?**

a.  imputation is performed by replacing the missing genotype with the
    most probable genotype based on phased haplotypes in an
    ancestry-matched reference population\
b.  imputation is performed by assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and
    using estimates of alleles frequencies to predict the missing
    genotype\
c.  imputation is performed by replacing the missing genotype call with
    the most common genotype at a locus in an ancestry-matched
    population\
d.  imputation is performed using a machine learning approach that
    predicts the genotype from prior knowledge of disease status

In practice there are significant challenges with phasing and imputation
in low coverage data.

First and foremost, low frequency alleles are the most difficult to
impute and imputation accuracy is much lower at sites with variants that
are at low frequency in the human population. Unfortunately, these are
the mutations that are most likely to be causal for human disease.

Another challenge is that it is computationally expensive (both long
compute times and resources) to impute large numbers of samples
(hundreds of thousands to millions) typical of biobank scale projects.
Still another challenge is that reference populations are at present
primarily restricted to individuals of European ancestry and thus
accurate imputation is primarily limited to this population.

In this task, you will execute GLIMPSE2 to impute missing genotypes from
a downsampled individual (NA12878) from the 1000 Genomes Project.

Before beginning, use `srun` on the HPC to switch from login to compute
node then clone the github repository for GLIMPSE2 as follows:

``` bash
git init
git clone https://github.com/odelaneau/GLIMPSE
```

The GLIMPSE2 tutorial is designed to be run from within the `tutorial/`
directory. The first step is to create soft links to the GLIMPSE2
binaries (executables/programs) that have been created for you in this
directory `/scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/bin`.

``` bash
cd GLIMPSE/tutorial
mkdir bin
cd bin
ln -s /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/bin/GLIMPSE2_chunk_static GLIMPSE2_chunk
ln -s /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/bin/GLIMPSE2_concordance_static GLIMPSE2_concordance
ln -s /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/bin/GLIMPSE2_ligate_static GLIMPSE2_ligate
ln -s /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/bin/GLIMPSE2_phase_static GLIMPSE2_phase
ln -s /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/bin/GLIMPSE2_split_reference_static GLIMPSE2_split_reference
ls -al # including "l" option allows you to see the symbolic link
```

The 1000 genomes reference panel (chromosome 22 only) is provided as a
phased VCF. Your instructor downloaded it for you. Return to your the
`tutorial/` directory and copy the 1000 Genomes project reference panel
and its index file to this directory. Note in all of the `cp` commands
below the `.` is the destination directory and is shorthand for the
present working directory.

``` bash
cd ..
pwd # confirm you are in tutorial directory
cp /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/CCDG_14151_B01_GRM_WGS_2020-08-05_chr22.filtered.shapeit2-duohmm-phased.vcf.gz .
cp /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/CCDG_14151_B01_GRM_WGS_2020-08-05_chr22.filtered.shapeit2-duohmm-phased.vcf.gz.tbi .
```

Next, the workflow uses `bcftools` a popular toolkit for manipulating
VCF files. This step removes NA12878 and family members from the
reference population VCF and retains only biallelic SNPs. It then
creates a sites-only VCF (no genotypes) which is used here to speed up
the imputation process (a standard imputation run would use phased
reference panel data). The new files are output to a new directory
`reference_panel`.

Copy the shell scripts for this exercise to the `tutorial/` directory.

``` bash
cp /scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/step*sh . 
```

Then run the first step the first script. This takes about 5 to 10
minutes. This is a pre-processing step that removes the focal sample
(the one you will impute genotypes from a downsampled BAM) and its
relatives from the reference panel.

``` bash
sbatch step2.sh
```

When the step2.sh job is complete, proceed to the next step where
GLIMPSE2 scans a chromosome and creates a set of intervals ('chunks')
where imputation will be performed separately. The output file of this
step is `chunks.chr22.txt`. This takes a minute or so.

``` bash
sbatch step3.sh 
```

The workflow then iterates over the chunks and splits the reference
panel VCF into pieces. In the process, it converts VCF into a sparse
matrix binary formatted file for each chunk (for efficient data
processing). Efficient storage of reference panel data is one of the
innovations that GLIMPSE2 uses to speed up computation necessary for
imputation on biobank scale data.

This step takes about a minute.

``` bash
sbatch step4.sh 
```

All of the above concerned processing of the reference panel. You now
have a reference panel split into segments in a format suitable for the
GLIMPSE2 imputation algorithm. You will now impute genotypes of a low
coverage sample. The genome of NA12878 was downsampled to 1X coverage.
The phase and impute step will both phase (determine haplotypes) and
impute (call genotypes) at all SNP positions in the reference panel.

A key thing to note in `step5.sh` is the GLIMPSE2_phase command. Note
that the input is a BAM file. Tools like GLIMPSE2 calculate genotype
likelihoods (the probability of the reads given the genotype) directly
from raw reads (like a SNP caller). Further these GLIMPSE enhances
haplotype inference by utilizing the phase information in sequencing
reads ("phase informative reads"). If a read (or read pair) spans two
heterozygous sites in the 1X coverage genome then the phase can be
inferred directly from the reads themselves.

Now execute the phasing and imputation step which will output one binary
representation of VCF (BCF) per chunk with phased and imputed genotypes
for the sample of interest. This takes about 10 minutes.

``` bash
sbatch step5.sh
```

Now stitch the chunks together to form a chromosome-level phased and
imputed output BCF.

``` bash
sbatch step6.sh 
```

Now, run the last step to calculate the genotype accuracy at different
minor allele frequencies bins (in the reference panel) in the 1X sample
and that in the original high coverage sample.

``` bash
sbatch step7.sh 
```

Finally, `cd` into the `plot` directory and perform the following.

``` bash
# first remove existing plot that came from Github
rm accplot.png

# the script has already been made executable so you can execute directly
./concordance_plot.py
```

This will create the accplot.png plot.

To make clear the role of imputation in low coverage data, review the
output imputed genotypes. Since BCF files are binary, we have to view
them with bcftools view. Load the most recent bcftools module, then view
the BCF file `NA12878_chr22_ligated.bcf` produced by your workflow in
GLIMPSE_ligate directory.

``` bash
bcftools view NA12878_chr22_ligated.bcf | less # q to exit
```

When answering questions below, you may need to refer back to the VCF
specification (see link above). When executing commands below, please
also use the same `.bcf` output, but from your instructor's GLIMPSE2 run
to ensure interpretations of results to not differ in different runs.
The imputed output from your instructor's run is at
`/scratch/work/courses/BI7653/hw5.2024/GLIMPSE2/NA12878_chr22_ligated.bcf`.

**Q2.2 What is the genotype call (in nucleotides) for position
chr22:10662116? \[ 1 point \]**

a.  A\|A\
b.  G\|G\
c.  C\|C\
d.  A\|G

Now, review the 1X BAM alignment with the samtools text view program and
determine how many reads support the genotype at position
chr22:10662116. Execute the following command from within the
`tutorial/` directory.

``` bash
samtools tview -p chr22:10662116 NA12878_1x_bam/NA12878.bam reference_genome/hs38DH.chr22.fa.gz # type ? to see help and type q to exit
```

**Q2.3 What is the depth of coverage at position chr22:10662116? \[ 1
point \]**

a.  0\
b.  1\
c.  2\
d.  4

The concept of phase is central to imputation and to many areas of in
population genomics and genomic medicine. In Illumina short read
sequencing, phase is not output by SNP-calling software but must be
inferred by tools like GLIMPSE2 or other phasing + imputation
approaches. Phased data can be recognized by the "\|" genotype
delimiter. Consider two SNPs in a phased VCF with the following REF, ALT
and sample genotype (GT) information:

``` bash
REF     ALT     GT
A       T       0|1
G       A       1|0
```

**Q2.4 What are the inferred haplotypes in the above sample? \[ 1 point
\]?**

a.  AT, GA\
b.  AG, TA\
c.  AA, TG\
d.  none of the above

How accurate are imputed genotype calls from 1X data? Download the
`acc_plot.png` that you generated above. This plot shows how well the
imputed genotype predicts the true genotype (in the same high coverage
sample in the reference panel) as measured by r2 in different minor
allele frequency bins, where the minor allele frequency is defined as
the frequency of the rarer of two alleles at a biallelic SNP site in the
reference panel.

**Q2.5 If we define 90% r2 as sufficiently accurate for an application
such as Genome-wide Association Study, then how low a minor allele
frequency can be accurately imputed using this approach? \[ 1 point \]**

a.  \~.01-.02%\
b.  \~.1-.2%\
c.  1-2%\
d.  5-10%

**Q2.6 Upload your acc_plot.png file to Homework 5B (2024) \[ 4 points
\].**
